How to play the game: 
The goal of the game is to avoid the spinners
using the mouse. As the game progresses, the difficulty level increases
(i.e. the velocity and number of spinners on the board increases). The user
have three tries. To reset the game, the user can press 'r'.

Ideas included:
We constructed a basic spinner and used inheritance to create the
different spinners the user sees in the game. Whenever we needed
a different implementation of a spinner property, we overwrote the
propotype (for example, the RedSpinners draw function). The spawn functions
takes the constructors as values to determine which spinner to create
next. We used closures to determine the distance the green spinner travels.
